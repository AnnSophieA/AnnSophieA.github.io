        <h2>Universal Voice-Activated Television Remote</h2>
        <h3> My capstone team designed, prototyped, and created a final design for a 
            voice-activated remote control. It is intended to help the elderly who have poor 
            eyesight, to be able to change the channel on their TV by pressing a button on their 
            remote and saying out loud what channel they would like to watch.</h3>
        <h2>Single Server Truly Parallel Password Cracker</h2>
        <h3> Listens for a list of password hashes multicast on a private network. Decrypts
             password hashes back to their four-character plain text equivalent. Returns these 
             plain text passwords to a TCP server nominated by the multicast server. The passwords 
             are cracked on 24 available CPUs with no idle time.</h3>
